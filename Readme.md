## Final Project

### The IronStack

The IronStack is a web-based application which aims to aid the learning process by providing a platform for the users to interact, collaborate and grow.
We completed this web-app as group of three.

The Backend was set-up using Adonis which is a Node-js framework.
The Frontend was built using AngularJS.
Bulma-CSS frame work was used for styling.
The application is also integrated with Slack API.
